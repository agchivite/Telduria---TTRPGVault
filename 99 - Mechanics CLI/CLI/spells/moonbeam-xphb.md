# Moonbeam
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a moonseed leaf
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [Dim Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) fills the Cylinder, and you can take a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `2d10` Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the [Polymorph](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 2.
