# Find Familiar
*1st-level, Conjuration (ritual)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/find-familiar.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 hour unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, burning incense worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: [Bat](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/bat-xphb.md), [Cat](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/cat-xphb.md), [Frog](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/frog-xphb.md), [Hawk](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hawk-xphb.md), [Lizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/lizard-xphb.md), [Octopus](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/octopus-xphb.md), [Owl](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/owl-xphb.md), [Rat](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rat-xphb.md), [Raven](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/raven-xphb.md), [Spider](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/spider-xphb.md), [Weasel](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/weasel-xphb.md), or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.

## Telepathic Connection

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a [Reaction](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.

## Combat

The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own [Initiative](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

## Disappearance of the Familiar

When the familiar drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

## One Familiar Only

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.
