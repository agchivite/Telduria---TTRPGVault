# Darkness
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, bat fur and a piece of coal
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, magical [Darkness](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [Darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) or [Dim Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock); [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb); [Monk (Warrior of Shadow)](list-spells-classes-monk-xphb-warrior-of-shadow-xphb)
